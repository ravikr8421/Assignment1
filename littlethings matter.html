     <p>You may have heard these things many times from many people. However, one can't speak of exam
    and not mention these little things that matter. </p>
   <p> Organize yourself before the exam. To begin with, pack your exam essential the previous evening
    . These include statinary, and your hall ticket and identity card among othe things. </p>
   <p> 
     Acquainting yourself with the exam centre will help you get rid of last-minute jitters before exam 
     .Make it a point to arrive early. A later or delayed entry creates avoidable panic, which will affect you
    adversly.
   </p> 
   <p>
     Follow all the rules with the exam centre; take only permitted items inside the examination room.

   <p>
     <strong> Don't be in a hurry to start writing the answer. Take a minute ot two to read the instruction
    and question paper properly. </strong> 
   </p> 
   <p> 
     On coming back home after the exam, make sure your hall ticket and other exam essentials are kept safely,
    as they will be needed again.
   </p>
   <p>
      Exam times are nothing out of the ordinary. Stick to your normal routine, your everyday 
      stationary---including something as minute as your regular pen---and comfortable clothes.
     Sticking to normality helps calm one's mind and averts unexpected surprises.
